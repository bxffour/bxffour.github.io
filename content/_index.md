# Welcome

Hi, I’m Nana, an SRE on planet Earth.

I’m interested in Go, C, Rust, low-latency systems, data systems, and performance engineering. On a normal day I build and maintain highly performant data systems—or maybe I just hang around data engineers more than I should.

I’m looking to become a better engineer, one book, blog, and paper at a time. I also have a [blog](/posts/) section where I share my thoughts every now and then.

Check out the [Library](/docs/reading_lists/) for a list of [Books](/docs/reading_lists/books/), [Blogs](/docs/reading_lists/blogs/) and [Papers](/docs/reading_lists/papers/) I’m exploring on this journey.
