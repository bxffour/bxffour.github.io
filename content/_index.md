# Welcome to My Blog

Hi, I'm Nana Baffour, a Site Reliability Engineer with a passion for understanding how the technologies that power the world really work. This blog is my journal as I embark on a journey to move past the surface and explore the depths of the systems and tools that run everything around us.

## What This Blog is About

Here, I'll be sharing insights, discoveries, and learnings as I dive deep into the low-level details of systems engineering, operating systems, and distributed technologies. You can expect:

- **Deep Dives** into topics like Firecracker, unikernels, Linux internals, and eBPF.
- **Recommendations** for tools, workflows, and strategies for tackling technical challenges.
- **Book Reviews** on essential reads for engineers and enthusiasts.
- **Personal Reflections** on the joys and challenges of being on this quest for understanding.

## About Me

By day, I work as a Site Reliability Engineer, building and maintaining systems that prioritize reliability, scalability, and performance. By night (and sometimes day), I'm on a quest to delve into how everything works—from the kernel to the cloud, from microkernels to distributed systems.

## Why This Blog?

My goal is to document this journey, share what I learn, and hopefully spark curiosity in others who want to go beyond the surface. Whether you're a fellow engineer, a curious learner, or someone looking for recommendations and insights, I hope you'll find value here.

Let’s explore, learn, and craft reliability together. Welcome aboard!
